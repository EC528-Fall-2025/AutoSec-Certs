# Automated and Secure Digital Certificate Management


## 1. Vision and Goals of the Project
- **Vision Statement:**  
  To build an automated and secure digital certificate management service tailored for highly regulated financial firms, ensuring compliance, reliability, and ease of use.  

- **Key Goals:**  
  - Goal 1  
  - Goal 2  
  - Goal 3  

## Project Priorities (P0â€“P3)

| Priority | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **P0 (Must-Have: Core MVP)** | - Automate certificate requests and approvals through ServiceNOW.<br>- Ensure certificates and private keys are securely generated and stored (via Keyfactor + HashiCorp Vault ). | Core requirements |
| **P1 (High Priority: Security & Access Control)** | - Provide controlled access to certificates through HashiCorp Vault with IAM-based validation (using Google Cloud IAM roles ). | Core requirements |
| **P2 (Future: Lifecycle Enhancements)** | - Support seamless certificate lifecycle management, including issuance, renewal, rotation, and revocation (e.g., Cloud Scheduler + Vault APIs). | Future work |
| **P3 (Future: Reliability & Compliance)** | - Minimize operational risks of expired or compromised certificates in production systems.<br>- Implement monitoring, logging, and auditing (Google Cloud Monitoring, ServiceNOW logs, Vault audit logs). | Future work |
