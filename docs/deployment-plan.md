# Deployment Plan

This document outlines the phased approach for deploying our system to the cloud.  
The goal is to ensure stability, validate infrastructure early, and gradually integrate external dependencies.

---

## Phase 1: Local Validation with Docker
- Build and run the application locally inside Docker containers.  
- Verify containerization works as expected (dependencies, networking, startup).  
- Resolve any environment-related issues before moving to the cloud.

---

## Phase 2: Minimal Viable Deployment on Cloud Run
- Deploy the minimal viable version (core service only) to Google Cloud Run.  
- Validate:
  - Service startup and availability in a managed cloud environment.  
  - Autoscaling and basic monitoring.  
- Ensure the foundational cloud infrastructure is working properly.

---

## Phase 3: Incremental Integration of External Services
- Gradually add external dependencies to the cloud-deployed service:
  - **ServiceNow** integration for workflow automation.  
  - **Vault** integration for secrets and credential management.  
- Test each integration step-by-step to avoid introducing instability.  
- Confirm secure and reliable communication with external systems.

---

## Next Steps
- Document integration results for each phase.  
- Update CI/CD pipeline to automate container builds and deployments.  
- Expand monitoring and logging to cover new dependencies.
